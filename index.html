				<h4>What do you think of an app that helps you with cooking, saving money and reducing food waste?</h4>
				<p>Feed Me is a proposal for a mobile application that aims to make life easier for people who live alone and who need help to develop culinary skills since the dishes do not always turn out as imagined. In this way, our goal is to provide you with quality materials and recipes based on your grocery shopping and available ingredients! What's up? Like the idea? How about knowing a little more about our project?</p>

				<h3>2. Company history</h3>
				<img class= "company" src="images/office4.jpg" width="500px" alt="Feed Me">
				<p>Mario, Marta, Emilly, Luis, Rouguy, Miseon and Diego were a group of international exchange students studying at IÉSEG and they were all living alone in Lille. For most of them it was the first time living alone and, of course, they were worried about a lot of things. But, after the first week was over, they had the most trouble in the kitchen, either cooking or thinking of different recipes. They talked about this problem and they came up with the idea of creating a mobile app that helps you with exactly that problem. So, they surveyed a bunch of other students at IÉSEG to know if it was a good idea to develop the app. The results were encouraging so they decided to transform that idea into a reality.</p>

				<h3>3. Our Mission</h3>
				<img src="images/mission.png" width="400px" alt="OurMission">
				<p>Our mission is to help people that are living alone or that simply are struggling in the cooking department, by providing step by step recipes as well as sending notifications of when their ingredients are about to expire so they can use them before the expiration date. By doing this, we are helping them save money and also since they don’t throw out the food and this helps reduce food waste.</p>

				<h3>4. Our Vision</h3>
				<img src="images/vision.png" width="400px" alt="OurVision">
				<p>Our vision is to become a worldwide known mobile app and to be the top app in the cooking department. We live in a globalized and modern world in which there are a lot of different apps and mobile services, but by selecting the right target market and following the right steps, we aim to be a top app in the market.
				Another part of our vision is reducing food waste. There is a lot of food waste in the world nowadays and the members of this company don’t like to waste food so we aim to reduce that with the expiration date notifications feature of our app.

The app will be available in Google Play Store for android users and in the App Store for IPhone users. Our app will be free to download and it will be really easy to use to bring the best experience to all of the users. We will be constantly working on new ways and ideas to make the app better through various updates.
